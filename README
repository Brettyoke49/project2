Project description: (Also, what image did you draw?)
For starters, I chose to draw a shine sprite from one of my favorite
games as a kid, Super Mario Sunshine. Included are two classes,
shine.h and shine.cpp where I implemented a class that produces
shine sprites of a fixed size. The primary function (makeShine) can
be called any number of times with varying centers. Of course, the
shine sprites will overlap each other if you don't use a much larger
window.

The easiest part of this project:
Deciding what I wanted to draw. Also, setting the name, title, and
background color of the window. Picking a font was fun I suppose.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Triangles. I have a newfound respect for triangles. Filling
a triangle one pixel at a time was much much harder than I
expected, and I could not find a decent algorithm anywhere.
Eventually I settled for my own, and although it leaves a little bit
of empty space within some triangles, it does a pretty good job
for the most part.
